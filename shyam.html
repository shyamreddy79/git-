Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.

maven is a build tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project.                    Maven is an open-source build automation and project management tool widely used for Java applications. As a build automation tool, it automates the source code compilation and dependency management, assembles binary codes into packages, and executes test scripts.

Jenkins is a Java-based open-source automation platform with plugins designed for continuous integration. It is used to continually create and test software projects, making it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to integrate changes to the project and for consumers to get a new build.

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Continuous integration (CI) refers to the practice of automatically and frequently integrating code changes into a shared source code repository. Continuous delivery and/or deployment (CD) is a 2 part process that refers to the integration, testing, and delivery of code changes.

Jenkins is one of the open source and most robust CI/CD orchestration platform for ensuring that an organization can successfully build and deploy software across multiple platforms ...
Orchestration is the coordinated execution of multiple IT automation tasks or processes. Orchestration is usually applied across multiple computer systems, applications, and services to ensure that deployment, configuration management, and other processes are performed in the proper sequence

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery   .Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and moreâ€”making it easier to manage applications.

Ansible is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates, and more. Ansible's main strengths are simplicity and ease of use.
Ansible is an open-source, cross-platform resource provisioning tool. Furthermore, it aids in the integration of internally developed applications into your programmes, making the DevOps process easier. It is one of the most used DevOps Tools for orchestrating, automating, configuring, and managing IT infrastr


Terraform is an IAC tool, used primarily by DevOps teams to automate various infrastructure tasks. The provisioning of cloud resources, for instance, is one of the main use cases of Terraform. It's a cloud-agnostic, open-source provisioning tool written in the Go language and created by HashiCorp.

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

Site reliability engineers (SREs) work between development and operations, but not necessarily within DevOps proper. The concept of SRE has been around since 2003, which means that it's older than DevOps. The term was made popular by Ben Treynor, who created Google's Site Reliability Team.


Splunk is a big data platform that simplifies the task of collecting and managing massive volumes of machine-generated data and searching for information within it. The technology is used for business and web analytics, application management, compliance, and security.
